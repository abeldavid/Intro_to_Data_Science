# Project_4: How to import a csv file into python using PANDAS, do a simple imputations using fillna(value) and finally, do a Statistical Significance test (Welch's test) using Scipy 


# Data Set :

The dataset (csv-file format) we are using can be downloaded from http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics containing details of baseball players.

Add the path to the Lahman baseball csv that points to the Master.csv file and a path for the new csv.

# Objective:
Assume you will be reading in a csv file with the same columns that the
    #Lahman baseball data set has -- most importantly, there are columns
    #called 'nameFirst' and 'nameLast'.
    #1) Write a function that reads a csv
    #located at "path_to_csv" into a pandas dataframe and adds a new column
    #called 'nameFull' with a player's full name.
    #
    #For example:
    #   for Hank Aaron, nameFull would be 'Hank Aaron', 
	#
	#2) Write the data in the pandas dataFrame to a new csv file located at
	#path_to_new_csv
    #3) Pandas dataframes have a method called 'fillna(value)', such that you can
    # pass in a single value to replace any NAs in a dataframe or series. You
    # can call it like this: 
    #     dataframe['column'] = dataframe['column'].fillna(value)
    #
    # Using the numpy.mean function, which calculates the mean of a numpy
    # array, impute any missing values in our Lahman baseball
    # data sets 'weight' column by setting them equal to the average weight.
    # 
    # You can access the 'weight' colum in the baseball data frame by
    # calling baseball['weight']
    4)Performs a t-test on two sets of baseball data (left-handed and right-handed hitters).

    You will be given a csv file that has three columns.  A player's
    name, handedness (L for lefthanded or R for righthanded) and their
    career batting average (called 'avg').
    
    Write a function that will read that the csv file into a pandas data frame,
    and run Welch's t-test on the two cohorts defined by handedness.
    
    One cohort should be a data frame of right-handed batters. And the other
    cohort should be a data frame of left-handed batters.
    
    We have included the scipy.stats library to help you write
    or implement Welch's t-test:
    http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html
    
    With a significance level of 95%, if there is no difference
    between the two cohorts, return a tuple consisting of
    True, and then the tuple returned by scipy.stats.ttest.  
    
    If there is a difference, return a tuple consisting of
    False, and then the tuple returned by scipy.stats.ttest.
    
    For example, the tuple that you return may look like:
    (True, (9.93570222, 0.000023))
    """
